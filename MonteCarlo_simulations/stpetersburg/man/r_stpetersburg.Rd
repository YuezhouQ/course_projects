\title{Simulate St Petersburg game payoffs}
\usage{
r_stpetersburg(n, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer; number of samples to draw.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer seed for reproducibility. If \code{NULL}, the
current RNG state is used.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{n} containing the simulated payoffs.
}
\description{
Generates \code{n} independent draws from the St Petersburg distribution
where \eqn{P(X = 2^k) = 2^{-k}} for \eqn{k = 1, 2, \dots}.
}
\details{
The payoffs are constructed as \eqn{X = 2^K}, where \eqn{K} has a geometric
distribution with success probability 1/2. Note that \eqn{E[X] = \infty}.

\examples{
set.seed(1)
