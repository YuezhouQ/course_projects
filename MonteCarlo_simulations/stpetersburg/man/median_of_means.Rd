\title{Median-of-means estimator}
\usage{
median_of_means(x, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of data.}

\item{k}{Integer; number of blocks to use. If \code{k <= 1}, the ordinary
sample mean is returned.}
}
\value{
Numeric scalar; the median-of-means estimate.
}
\description{
Computes the median-of-means estimator for a numeric vector \code{x}.
The data are split (in order) into \code{k} groups of approximately equal size;
the group means are computed and the median of those means is returned.
}
\examples{
x <- r_stpetersburg(1000, seed = 123)
median_of_means(x, k = 10)

}
